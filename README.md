# Mushroom Picker üçÑ

## Installation
- `git clone '`
- `bundle`
- `rails s`

## Ideas for improvement
- Pagination. With more time, I'd implement pagination instead of just taking the first 100 items from the mushroom array.
- Testing. I typically use RSpec and in a program like this I'd expect to unit test the `MushroomHelper` (with mocks for the data service) and include integration tests for the UI.
